Crossplatform OpenGL engine for my needs (experiments, concepts, discovering, and learning). Code is a product of entropy and chaos, it maybe broken (definitly), do not try to build/run it in current state. Tree structure is changing from time to time, and forking is not suggested.

Happy coding :D
